## About

I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Ann Arbor, MI. My skills include C/C++ and Python programming as well as Linux and shell scripting. My interests include embedded systems and using software to interact with the physical world. In my free time, I design Arduino and Raspberry Pi based embedded systems. I enjoy solving problems and look forward to taking on new challenges.

## Recent Projects

### VTOL Flight Controller

I am currently working on a stabilizing flight controller for vertical take-off, radio-controlled aircraft. The video below shows the aircraft flying in the vertical flight mode during its first test flight. In the future, the aircraft will be able to transition into the horizontal flight mode where it will fly like an airplane.

### Autopilot Flight Controller

An Arduino based flight controller for radio-controlled aircraft. The flight controller uses a gyroscope and feedback loop to sense and control the aircraft's orientation. This system adds autopilot capability and makes the aircraft more stable and easier to fly.

### Linux System Monitor

A Qt application for monitoring CPU temperatures and other hardware. The application serves as a graphical front-end for [lm_sensors](https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors), featuring efficient real time plotting of sensor data.
