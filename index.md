## About

I am an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Ann Arbor, MI. My skills include C/C++ and Python programming as well as Linux and shell scripting. My interests include embedded systems and using software to interact with the physical world. In my free time, I design Arduino and Raspberry Pi based embedded systems. I enjoy solving problems and look forward to taking on new challenges.

## Recent Projects

### VTOL Flight Control System (Version 2)

I am currently working on a flight control system that will provide flight stabilization for VTOL aircraft. The system is built around the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. The system uses onboard sensors and a feedback loop to stabilize the aircraft in vertical flight. The unusual tail-sitter design simplifies the mechanical complexity and improves the durability of the aircraft.

### VTOL Flight Control System

An Arduino-based flight control system that uses a gyroscope and feedback loop to stabilize the aircraft in vertical flight. I have abandoned this project in favor of new aircraft design that should be more robust and controllable.

### Autopilot Flight Control System

An Arduino-based flight control system for radio-controlled aircraft. The flight controller uses a gyroscope and feedback loop to sense and control the aircraft's orientation. This system adds autopilot capability and makes the aircraft more stable and easier to fly.
